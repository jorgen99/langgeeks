This approach is going to be matrix based.
The board is represented by a 8x8 matrix (or array or 8 arrays, whatever works).



* Notes on how to get Factor working.

Best way is to clone the git repo:

git clone http://github.com/slavapestov/factor.git
cd factor
./build-support/factor.sh update

Make sure you have mesa-libGL-devel or whatever it is called in your distro.
